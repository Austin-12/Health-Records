Computerization of Health Records

In this project I created a health profile class for a person this application would
be used to share a patients health records amongs health professionals. I've had some practice
with object oriented programming in the past, but doing this project I learned alot more about
using a constructor. I also couldn't figure out the true purpose of having private methods until
this project. I figured out that using these private methods helps to encapsulate the logic in my methods.
This helps keep the implementation details hidden as well as promotes code maintanability.

How to run: upon running the main method you will be prompted to add the patients details
it is pretty simple to run.

improvements: I can see right now what I should do. First I need to add exception handling
for user input errors. I also decided to add a print all details method that will print all of the patients info
about the patient. Lastly I could prompt the user to enter how many patients you want to enter at once
and create those objects in a loop.
